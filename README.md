Image Autotations
--------------------------
--------------------------


Overview
--------
This repository contains the code and other files written during our senior research project. Our goal is to use a convolutional neural network on a web application to identify types of disasters in images. We have two convolutional neural networks, one for multi-class classification, identifying disaster type, and another for multi-label classification, identifying not only the type of disaster found in the image but also relevant details important for search and rescue teams, such as damage done to buildings and/or vegetation.


Requirements
------------

We used Python, PyTorch, fast.ai, streamlit


Installation
------------

Download all the files and change the path variable in "webapp.py" to the location of the "export.pkl" file.


Running
-------

In the terminal cd to the location of the webapp. Then do "streamlit run webapp.py"
