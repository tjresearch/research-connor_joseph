IMAGE GATHERING AND ANNOTATION TOOLS
Scraping images from websites? Although, I think this site costs money, but maybe we can find one for free.

This one might work:

Imagery dataset I found. It would probably be best if we could get a tool that can scrape the images from this.

MIT’s own image annotation tool.

Code for downloading images from a website. But, will it work for my needs?

Annotation tools:
Will probably work but seems like really professional and expensive

I am not super sure how to use this or if it will work but it supposedly labels bounding boxes in an image
https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg/blob/master/labelImg.py

Could work, free to an extent, was trying to make it work wasn’t working too well, intended for medicine but people use it for whatever.

Sign ups closed for now, but the fourth box down looks like what we need

For labelImg can open up the thing to manually do it and review things.
Annotation format seems pretty simple when I looked at it in text file
Can probably write to it with the xml extension in the format they have and make it work
Need to figure out how to use pascal vos format to feed into and out of NN
	Or we could just access label files and extract info
Can probably write a code to annotate a bunch in that format as long as they are all the same annotation
	Then we can rewrite for a different set after

WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
Director Docs for creating web servers (I think it’s beginner-friendly, just perfect for us):

“i believe i found a way to make the streamlit website accessible with the url using docker”
“i havent tested yet but i found it in an article so it seems pretty credible”
“doing this would mean the thing is entirely off director”

^might help with putting weird sized pictures in
White also suggest less cool methods like squish or crop (the middle of) the image
