		\subsection*{Monday September 23}
		I made a program that could take the pixel values of images and put them next to the corresponding annotations in the csv file. I didn't test it though.
		
	    
	    
		\subsection*{Tuesday September 24}
	    Tested the program I made on Monday, and debugged some things.
	    One was the values being added to the end of the file instead of lines being added on to like I wanted. Another one was it wasn't skipping the first line (the name of the labels). 
	    
	    
	    
	    
		\subsection*{Thursday September 26}
	    Revised some nn code to make it usable for us. Haven't tested it too thoroughly yet.

		\hline 
	\textbf{Date} & \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Met}\\ \hline
		\hline
		9/23 & Get an applicable neural network and start coding it. Goal for this is to classify if an image is something or not. &  we found that creating manual annotations took quite some time, so we didn't have time to do this. \\
		\hline
		9/30 & Get an applicable neural network and start coding it. Goal for this is to classify if an image is something or not. & I did start and I also made a program to resize and convert to grey scale. \\
		\hline
		10/7 & Finish the NN and/or begin work on making a web app. & The first version is nearly finished. Probably one or two more days. \\
		\hline
		10/14 & Start the web app. Be able to put an image file into the web app and have annotations for it automatically generated. &  \\
		\hline
		10/21 & Finish the web app. &  \\

% ------ SECTION REFLECTION  -------------------------------------
	\section*{Reflection}
			The one or two more days of nn stuff will probably be done at home while I work on the web app in school because I feel like we are falling behind where we should be. That is also why I am predicting another week of web app stuff even though I don't think we will need it.
			
			The plan between me and my partner right now, is for me to start making the web app and for him to decrease the error in our nn.
